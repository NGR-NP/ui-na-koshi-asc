              Addiction is a complex disease that affects individuals of all
              backgrounds. Itâ€™s characterized by compulsive drug seeking and
              use, despite negative consequences. Many people struggle with
              addiction due to genetic, environmental, and psychological
              factors.

              While addiction can be a challenging journey, recovery is
              possible. Through treatment, support, and personal commitment,
              individuals can break free from the grip of addiction and rebuild
              their lives. If you or someone you know is struggling with
              addiction, know that help is available.
